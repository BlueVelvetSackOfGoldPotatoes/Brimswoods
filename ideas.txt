Dialogue ideas: 

Camelot and Grant, as she greets him:
Camelot "Hoi stranger, what can I get you?".
Grant, wanting to be heard above the music and the crowd voices that aided the singer with his song, yelled huskly while pulling his hood back "Hoi miss, get me enough fists of yer best ale, enough that they'll drown me in piece". To which the bartender fired "Damned, you're in luck, that's the only ale we have - the best. And enough to drown a whale or two as well." 
"That is grand - but first, you do have a game table don't ya?"  
"The best in town as well - two shields, one per ale and 5 shields for sitting mid-game, ya? There's 5 old dogs going at it already" she said while walking around the oak counter, "Follow my ass, but don't stare at it cause I'll feel it you cheeky bastard." She smiled with her round face and tapped her nose on the side. The remark made him jolly even before getting to the ale. The tavern had a big oak counter that went for half the length of the room, stooles filling it with people. A small stage composed of board and a couchened chair at its centre which looked like the most expensive item in the room - its legs were worked into ivery and flowers - took their place facing the room.

Grant looked down as if to test an hypothesis that he had - perhaps she wasn't a wizard afterall - and followed Camelot to the game table. To get there they had to walk past half of the house. It had a good sample of the diversity one gets in life - Grant saw a very fat man laughing hard, looking like a red baloon so full that it was ready to burst - everyone else in the table was crying of laughter and hiting the table perhaps more from seeing the man's state then from whatever had caused it. Another table, this time three bearded woman sat staring at Grant as he passed by them, having stoped their words abruptly - "STUMP!" Grant looked back at the sound of broken wood and saw the fat man rolling on the floor - he was now laughing purple.  
"Do these cunts even know what night it is?" - Camelot looked back at Grant's incredulous face while squeezing through tables "Ups, excuse me - uh - behind you. Well, they do - Ugh, sorry - that's why they are here and drunk. For protection. I don't know where you're from, but around here drinking is our way of avoiding the little bitches miasmas. It worked for my grandad and it sure works for the folk now."

SET - Battlefield scared with dead corpses, mud and broken trees. Blood pools and fire burns here and there. Grant is walking without a direction or intent - the war was theirs, he won.  He looks up - a dandelion.

A dandelion seed swam through the cold northern breeze, and he saw it and cherished that moment as if it was his own life he was seeing. He almost didn't notice it happening. But he did and his eyes shattered in a dozen glassy tears, rough tears that hit the ground hard. If it wasn't for that spore, that drop of fleeting life that hang on with all its purpose to some line of potentiality, thin but heavy as the world, he wouldn't have remembered that he might have died. And it might have never happen, but to him, the possibility of it was a miracle - his whole existence fell to his feet and buried itself along with the seeds that never were, might be and would be, soon, beautiful sunny dandelions. Not all, but most of which came down floating on a soft northern breeze.

The wizard is what actual is protecting the whole inn, not drinking - he aludes to this matter by making fun and calling them deaf cunts. 

NOTE - there will be someone pretending to save the green lady with a fake bow, but since the lady is pretending to be a baboon, he shoots her instead - this is an act of comedy.\
