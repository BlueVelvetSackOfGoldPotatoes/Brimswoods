PROLOGUE - A HEAVY SWORD TO CARRY

"Zzzzzshhhhhhghrr" Grant's long sword echoed across the field as it dragged over inanimate things and pierced the earth - "cling!" it sounded, as it found a broken bronze helm still attached to its head - only recognizable thanks to the helm - a dented thing with the house of its wearer, a simple oak, carved into it on iron. The sound scared nearby crows that were picking on the rags of mulled man. The first bird and the easiest to frighten set off cawing, after it followed its band flying up through the smog and complaining aloud annoyed at the lost of nutritious potential. It seemed like a loud night falling upwards had covered the gray skies and as if for a moment everything had simply been an awful nightmare.
 
 At the top of the beaten smoking hill sat the warlord. The banner of his country sprawl open at the winds like a massive wing. In it a powerful elk embroidered in royal blue took the center of the flag with its front vigorous legs in the air and green emeralds shinning in the place of its eyes. Five gold stars hang in front of the beast, one for each castle in the kings realm. Elric's long black curls hang bellow his untouched gold platted armored shoulders. These, along with his straight head formed a proud arrow that pointed towards the sky - the only thing above him now. He barely moved in his massive battle wagon where he sat in a small wooden tower overseeing the remains of the battlefield. The view was scarred with corpses, mud and broken things. To an observer, the King seemed too calm, almost dormant, specially since he had just won the battle that gave him the war. 
 
 After this day the country was unified again under the crown, the rebellion having been finally vanquished. Children would sing songs in Elrics name and he would be written on the right side of history books. But something more pressing filled Elric's mind - he wouldn't be the only one written on the pages of history and tongues of story. The warlord pointed his sharp blue eyes slowly as he followed the target responsible for his victory that morning. But instead of pride or relief at the sight of his hero, alive and standing, Elrics expression was one of caution - someone else would've shown fear after seeing what Grant did during that battle, but Elric was a king and a king shows no fear. 
 
 It was known only in tales. The ones grandmothers tell to their grandchildren at lunch. Grandmothers have a different hunger from their small heirs, but equally big in appetite. They seem to feed on children's imagination, the stuff which dreams are made of, where immortality lays. These tales have many aperitifs that spread through the meal and taste of different memories, but somehow always come back to the main course, the story thus proceeding. And if one is lucky, if the child's imagination is running wild like fire and the story teller is a mature worthsmith, an ending with a flourish like fireworks in a dark night should be served as desert. And this fortunately is such a tale. One that everyone in the kingdom should know from their merry child years. About warriors who had been chosen by the gods - or as it was usually put - touched. The stories tell of brave honorable fighters who at some point during an important battle revealed powerful magical gifts never before seen or felt by the warriors themselves. Some spit fire, others froze every enemy they touched, some gained the strength of 10 elephants and the agility of a cheetah - whatever the skill, the warrior would involuntarily win the battle. Like William the Darthpoint, who's arrows would fly through whole legions before stopping, or Elban The Mighty Roar who's war cry would send his enemies into madness and fright, unleashing chaos and confusion behind enemy lines. But this wasn't a recent tale. They were known. There were old paintings that hung in royal halls, crafted by hands long gone about such stories portraying such heroes. And Elric knew them. Although he could not admit it, the cold sweat that permeated his unsoiled hands, the panic that had installed in his noble bowels after witnessing Grant, after living through a myth and all the bloodshed, they told him that he felt fear form Grant and that wouldn't do or he did not hold the kingdom's crimson crown over his head.   
 
As he dragged his tired sword across death, Grant caught a glimpse of a dandelion seed. It swam through the cold northern breeze and now he saw it, cherishing the moment as if it was his own life he was witnessing. He almost didn't notice it happening. But he did and his eyes shattered in a dozen glassy drops reflecting the surrounding destruction, rough tears that hit the ground hard, like lifeless bodies. If it wasn't for that spore, that drop of fleeting life that hang on with all its purpose to some line of potentiality, thin but heavy as the world, he wouldn't have remembered all the people he just erased and that he himself might have died. It might have never happened, but for him, the possibility of it was a miracle - his whole existence fell to his feet and buried itself along with the seeds that never were, might be and would be, soon, beautiful sunny dandelions, coming down floating on the winter winds of the north. Grant caught Elrics eyes, a lion staring at an eagle, high on its royal nest, and he knew then that he would never be able to lift his sword for the warlord again, or in any war for that matter. While he eyes Elric, his king, Grant wiped his red eyes, then his red sword on his cape and sheathed his powerful long sword for the last time on its holster. 

Night had settled and a cold mist involved the camp tents. Small fires that offered a big comfort permeated the field between large shared bulky tents. Tired warriors, now veterans, all of them, spoke above the fires over pig sausages, dry bread and dark cold ale. 

"For the last time, can someone please give me the jar or fill my cup? I ain't askin another time." Peter didn't stop his voice while handing, almost throwing, the jar at George " - I am telling you the king is going to promote him from Phalange leader to fucking head of Joint - No! Hand, they'll make him a fucking Hand! What a hero man". He was very excited. While George poured himself more ale from the clay jar he let himself whisper mindlessly "I saw sir Grant slash a complete line of full armored riders and their mounts with his sword. Just a sword". 
"You're spilling, man! Good ale by the way and not enough as it is, you know that." Robert, the oldest of the group, yelled from his tree stump where he sat slapping his thigh. George wiped the golden liquid from his trousers with a swift hand making an angry face. "And you should be glad about it." Robert continued "Sir Grant won us the war of the century, maybe of our millennium. I don't know about you George, but I want to go home. Enough with the damned insurgents and their Blockist ideas, they've brought enough death with their opinions as it is, to our people and our country. Let them rot." A long pause followed, sullen with heavy consciouses. Until Robert smirked, pulling on his beard "I also have a wife mind you. And I don't want her to turn into a scabbardita - you know what happens to the mind of a fisherwoman who's not seen a man for too long. The sea turns holes into pillars and pillars into holes. Besides, what you witnessed has its place in tales, gods damn me. It's a miracle and he should be awarded for it." Robert finished his sentence looking straight into the blazing flames while his bread dripped the sausage grease on the dark earth. Remembering what they saw made his words of praise fall from a stout and droopy mouth. 

His leg was shaking when a big heavy hand fell on his shoulder and brought him back to reality. It was a warm hand that grasped him with friendship and nostalgia.
"Sir Grant!" Robert managed to say while turning and saluting his Phalange Commander by reflex. Others that sat around the fire copied Roberts instinct.  "Relax Robert. All of you commoners, relax." Grant scratched at his nape "I am no longer your Commander so don't." He wore a tired smile "Mind if I sit?" He asked as he sat "I bring juice from the high tables, so throw the piss your drinking there, where piss belongs" He said emptying the clay jar himself onto a bush behind Robert and filling it from a big metallic jug. Everyone was silent but restless while Grant filled everyone's cup from the clay jar and drank directly from the metallic jug himself. Peter finally broke the silence with over excited words that fell from his mouth awkwardly loud "Were you promoted to Hand of the army?" - Robert immediately slapped Peter hard on the back of the head "Au!" Peter argued to which Robert answered "What the fuck boy, address Sir Grant properly!" Robert's face flushed red and Grant spit the wine he was drinking in a burst of laughter. Robert slithered from closed teeth in Peter's ear "What is the matter with you? Have you finally shat the small amount of wits y'ere born with?" "Robert you might have dislodged his head man. Are you alive boy? Pronounce your name, a little softer this time, please." Peter was still rubbing his head and gasping for air when he managed to answer "I am peter. I mean my name is. Sir! Sir Grant!" with emphasis on the <<sir's>>. Peter eyed Robert with fiery eyes while he spoke "Have you, Sir Grant, ex commander of our Phalange, been commended to a higher rank, sir?" Robert eyed him back in equal manner "I do not suppose that after your deeds in todays battle, that you haven't been promoted... Sir!" " Well, Peter, as a matter of fact I have." Grant opened his arms towards the camp. "I am now Hand. Leader of all these dogs. Commoners, Epics, Phalange groups, Carpals, Joints and all that shit. I have been endowed with the titles of Hero and Rare, even martyr, although I live... <<Hyuch>>, I hope not for longer" he hiccuped again and what happened next caught Grant's drunk self unguarded and he almost cried although no one would ever know that, not even sober Grant. Everyone knelled. Without a worth, first the soldiers around the fire then soldiers walking by and further. Each unsheathed their weapons, stabbed them in the earth if they had a pointy part or simply laid before them, head bowed down in respect. All paid allegiance to him. 

It was a cold night outside of The Round Table where the finest ale in town was served. It was also the only inn ever built in the spell hunted town of Brimswoods. Made from enchanted green apples and milky beechwood honey - ingredients grown in the woods surrounding the inn and its tavern - the ale was sweet and mistakenly light to the palate for it kicked like a mule. Some say it would even make you hallucinate fantastic things if you drank enough of it without summoning it back up again. Regardless of the brew, the town's night owls, travelers, drunks and vagabonds seemed to have gravitated towards each other, perhaps for fear, perhaps for celebration, and together ended up at the tavern in that magical holiday night of no moons.

The town was an old one. It had been governed by different lords across time and the townspeople were used to passing things - they were nostalgic but disconnected. Being the greenest patch of land of a southern Port country it was very desirable and searched for. Ships and traders passed through it constantly as did their languages and costumes. Its rich coast line and sea bursting with fish as well as extensive fields of fertile land ready to birth fat crops were the bread and butter of the townspeople. The woman were mainly fishers and man usually worked the fields, both were relaxed and easy going. The timber, oceans of trees that diffused into rivers of forests whose arms extended through the land profusely, was dark brown outside but inside a rare purple hue spiraled through it, making it very popular for building furniture among nobility from far away lands. The current family that received the town's taxes was the Bricks. They came to power through marriage - their youngest daughter paired with the eldest duke from the Stone family, the previous family that received the towns taxes and protected them against unprecedented threats that never came. The towns most wanted crop was a drug, a mild tranquilizer that the farm hands relished in their teas, the fisherwoman smoked in their purple wood pipes and foreign powers wanted to keep out of their borders while their rulers stashed full coffers the size of houses with it, enjoying its effects wholeheartedly. All the lords knew the plant's humble tale that had its origin in Brimswoods and everyone told some version of it - there once was a poor man that watered his crops with sea water. Everyone in town called him crazy-leg, not because he was crippled, although he was, but because they thought him crazy - you see, the gossip was that he had drank a little bit too much of the ocean he used to water his hypothetical plants. These never grew of course, because of the salt in the water. One day, old crazy-leg woke up in the middle of the night. The wind whistled at his wooden door and rain knocked at his windows and a loud weep creped into his ears. He limped out of bed, and since his house was but a room he couldn't avoid staring at the black door. The weeping got louder at times, coming in bursts, filling him with chills. Old crazy-leg lit his night candle and then with it a cigarette he always kept on his night stand to help with his nerves and continued the limping towards his door, the weeping now sounding more like a saw brushing over some metal, lifted his skin making him feel like a cold chicken. He finished the rest of his cigarette with one deep drag and on its numbing nicotine he opened the door. A baby stared back at him from a white pillow deep from a straw basket. The water had not got to the baby yet. Old crazy-leg brought the baby inside and when he saw a note attached to the babies pajamas he threw it in a drawer - for he could not read, but since we can - the note said "Dear Willies, you might not remember me for like me the port holds many and I suppose you've seen most of them (from what I hear). Well, I cannot keep this baby for I am dying. And since half of it belongs to you I hope that you take her and care for her. I am sorry. Livia". The baby  was named Hope and Hope grew into a beautiful girl old enough to marry, and married she was by very Old crazy-leg, or as he was known in the brothels - Willies - he arranged her to marry the horse master's son - Bert, who's father was his Willies cousin. Old crippled Willies was getting too old now but his scientific endeavor still rushed through him like lightning. He would prove everyone wrong even if it killed him - he was going to show that sea water could grow crops, in fact, the best crops of all. One beautiful summer morning, when Willies was very sick and dying in his small wooden room that smelled of the sea, his daughter and her husband were desperately searching for some seed, any seed, in the hopes of bringing some rest to very old Willies. They searched the whole house for one until Hope stumbled upon something ancient made of now darkened straws - it was her old baby basket - old Willies had kept it all this time. She hugged the now yellow pillow and cried a little. Beneath it she found three seeds - golden and shinny yelling for her attention. She put them in her dress pocket and ran out to the field. With her slender white fingers she pierced the brown warm earth and one by one she placed the seeds in under a brilliant midday sun shinning over her. When she was done Bert hugged her making Hope cry again, her tears hit the three seeds. And involved by her salty water the seeds immediately grew out of the ground, green and strong with the bluest flowers she had ever seen. Bert and Hope rushed inside, picked old Willies up and limped him outside to see his dream come true and Old crazy-crippled died with a smile right there and then as the waves danced softly with the shore before them. 

Grant pulled softly on his mare and stopped amid the muddy road leading to the town's center. He was in the middle of a crossroad. To his right stood The Round Table and in it his eyes saw the promise of a fugue. To his left a "school" probably stood, as per indicated in dried flaky brown paint on a wooden arrow sign - he couldn't really see it in the surrounding darkness. And a "circus", or so the sign promised in striped blue and yellow fresh paint. Lured by the still distant sounds of leisure that streamed from the inn and its wooden comfort, he rode towards it. He had been looking for alcohol, a place to rest his tired horse and another, preferably different, to rest himself, so that he could forget about his big heavy body until sunrise. Then he would sell his amulets at the town's market as he had often done through the towns he passed. Magical amulets that he acquired through perfectly legal means, of course, but don't ask him twice about that. Other things were on his mind too, "It's fucking cold outside" as well as "the gods made this day not one for midnight travels...", and it wasn't, not even for him. So he rode towards the torch lit house. He stabled his dark brown mare on its own little inn by the side of The Round Table. The other horses didn't appreciate the nuisance, everything was restless in this dense night. He felt worried about his own mount and a small prayer produced in his mind "Fucking fairy month, let them steal any other horse but mine" - thus blessing the mare against all misfortunes, at least in his heart. As he walked towards the heavy wooden doors, laughter showered him, followed by the click clacking of glasses, the tune of a lute and his player's voice, accompanied by an orchestra of roaring fires and crackling wood. Grant pushed hard against the doors. Above them, under torch light read in big red and blue wooden letters "The Round Table".

 

Grant, having stepped in, was instantly involved by the tavern's insides - "Au!" was the first thing out of his big mouth, after a dressed monkey stomped his toes. A circus was in town and had clowned its way right inside the tavern. His yell was followed by two other onomatopoeias and their causal monkeys. These were wearing fisherwoman hats and held each others hands. The monkeys jumped on a round oak table and a senseless argument among the occupants and the monkeys ensued. These baboons were followed by a person dressed in a tight green body-piece decorated witch red squares. She also stepped over Grant. She ran behind the monkeys while imitating them by pursing her shiny lips and scratching her armpits. "Well, that's a lot of tavern to be stepping over my fucking feet", Grant burst out loud only to have his words drown in the sea of sound that filled the tavern in volume. As he traced the clowns with his weary dark eyes he reflected over the fact that the whole ground floor of the inn was, in fact, the tavern. He saw the bard playing on a small stage in front of five full tables where mostly crooked people sat in admiration. These seemed enchanted by the bards soothing love song about a prince and his so much desired princess, who obviously already had her hand promised to someone else, probably unworthy, older, smellier and uglier than the prince by an unmeasurable degree. Their enchantment leaped into a surprise when two circus people landed on the stage. Their surprise burst into laughter when one of these mimes pretended to be the bard by mimicking his every move, including sitting on an invisible chair - that is, after trying to sit on the bard´s lap. He mimicked and exaggerated the bards facial expressions while his colleague attempted to balance anything he could find about the stage and surrounding tables on the mime's head and limbs. The real bard pushed forth, trying his best to transmit the melancholy and faithfulness of his song, hopefully overtaking the comedic act unfolding over his own. Grant cracked a smile at the perverse scenario forgetting about his toes and pushed his way towards the bar. The whole inn smelled like buttery popcorn even though there wasn't any. As he was getting ready to interact with the bartender a man burst through the door armed with a bow and arrow wearing a green suit and a pointy hat with a red feather sticking out of it - "Where are you my lady!? I shall defeat the beasts who took you from me! Have no fear my pearl, for I - Nibor Doow, prince of the castles - have arrived, and I own so many many castles". 

Behind the bar was Camelot, a bear of a woman and the owner of The Round Table. She saw Grant approaching while she served ale - "Hoi stranger, what can I get ya? Never mind the silly goons".
Grant, wanting to be heard over the music and the crowded voices, pulled his yellow hood back and yelled huskily "Hoi miss, get me fists of yer best ale, enough to drown me in peace" - "you're in light, that's the only ale we have - the best. And enough to drown a whale or two as well." 
"That is grand! Take'em to the game table will ya? That is, if you have one."  
"The best in Brimswoods as well - two shields per ale and one crown for sitten mid-game, yes? There's three old dogs and two bitches goen at it already" she said while walking around the oak counter filled with drunks, "Follow my ass, but don't stare at it cause I'll feel it you cheeky bastard." She smiled with her round face and tapped her pointy nose on the side. The remark made him jolly even before the ale. The counter went for half the length of the room, stools filling it with noisy, lively people. The small stage had a couched chair where the bard sat at the center of the room - its legs worked into ivory and flowers, the chair was the most expensive item in the whole inn Grant thought.

"Sssssun!" an arrow flew over Grants head. Nibor Doow was shooting arrows across the room until he finally hit his target. The green lady who pretended to be a monkey gave a sharp yell, a twist and a theatrical flip followed by an ugly face and "STUMP" it sounded as she hit the boarded floor. "Ahah! I've got one of you monsters! Fear me now!" he yelled as he leaped forward and embarrassed one of the baboons, confusing it for his princess. "Worry not and cry no longer my clam, for I have saved you! And you'll have so many castles, one for each color of the rainbow!" the monkey kissed him on the lips and everybody laughed. "Do these cunts even know what night it is today?" - Camelot looked back at Grant's incredulous face while his body squeezed through tables "Ups, excuse me - uh - behen'ya. Well, they do - Ugh, sorry - that's why they are here and drunk. For protection."
Grant looked at Camelots butt to test an hypothesis he had - perhaps she wasn't a witch after all - and followed her to the game table. To get there they had to walk towards the furthest fireplace which sat in the far most corner of the room. On their way Grant saw an enormous man laughing very hard, looking like a red balloon, full and ready to burst - his table friends howled and cried, hitting the table and each other in hopes to cease their laughing attack. Another table, three bearded woman sat in a triangle and stared at Grant as he passed by, having stopped their words abruptly - "BANG!" Grant looked back at the sound of broken wood and saw the big man rolling on the floor - now laughing purple. A shrimp that had been lodged in his throat but had been expelled by his abrupt fall now laid on his forehead. Camelot's butt pushed a full grown man right out of his seat and onto the floor. "Oh by the gods, let me help yup fella" she turned at Grant while she helped the confused man up - "I done know where ye're from, but around here drinken is our way of avoiden the little bitches miasmes. It worked for ma granda and it sure works for the folk now." Grant grunted. It was a fucked up night. People died often. Not many, but Grant knew about it even though he was not from Brimswoods. At the moment, he wasn't from anywhere really, but it was all the same to him. At least the Inn was merry.
