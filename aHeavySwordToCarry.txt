It was a cold and dangerous night outside of Camelot's Table - the only inn ever built in the town of Brimswoods. Named after it's owner's family, a big stout woman in her 50's, Camelot served the finest (and only...) ale in town. Made from sweet green apples and beechwood honey, engredients grown in the woods surrounding the inn and its tavern, the ale was proper. But regardless of the brew, the townspeople seemed to have gravitated to eachother, perhaps for fear, perhaps for celebration, but it took just one farmhand to speak of the tavern for everyone to crowd the inn during that magical holiday. 

Grant stoped amid the muddy road leading to the tavern by pulling softly on his mare. Where the inn stood, his eyes saw the promise of a fugue. And so, Lured by the still distant sounds of leisure that streamed from the inn and the wooden comfort he rode towards it. He had been looking for alcohol, a place to rest his tired horse and another to rest himself, so that he could forget about his big heavy body until sunrise, but other things were on his mind too. "The gods know this month is not one for midnight traveleres..." Grant thought - and it wasn't, not even for him.  But first things first - alcohol. He stabled his dark brown mare on its own litle inn by the side of Camelot. The other horses didn't appreciate the nuisance, everything was restless in this heavy night of no moons. He felt worried for a second about his own mount and a small prayer produced in his mind "Fucking fairy month, let them steal any other horse but mine" - thus blessing the mare against all misfortunes, at least in his heart. As he walked towards the heavy wooden doors, laughter showered him, as did  the click clacking of glasses, the tune of a lute and his player's voice accompanied by an orchestra of roaring fire. These seemed to lift him off his weight and pull him towards the inn. Grant couldn't see anyone from the small windows, albeit them being made of glass, but he could read under the torch lights that hung on the outside walls of the house the big dark wooden sign, written in red and blue letters, " 's Table".
