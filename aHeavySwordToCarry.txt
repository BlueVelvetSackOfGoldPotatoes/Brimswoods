It was a cold and dangerous night outside of Camelot's Table - the only inn ever built in the town of Brimswoods. Camelot served the finest (and only...) ale in town. Made from green apples and beechwood honey, engredients grown in the woods surrounding the inn and its tavern, the ale was sweet and light but it kicked like a mule. Regardless of the brew, the town's nightowls, travelers, drunks and vagabonds seemed to have gravitated to eachother, perhaps for fear, perhaps for celebration, and together ended up at the tavern. No traveler seemed to want to sleep outdoors tonight and so the tavern was crowded in this magical holiday. 

Grant, pulling softly on his mare, stoped amid the muddy road leading to the tavern. Where the inn stood, his eyes saw the promise of a fugue. Lured by the still distant sounds of leisure that streamed from the inn and its wooden comfort he rode towards it. He had been looking for alcohol, a place to rest his tired horse and another to rest himself, so that he could forget about his big heavy body until sunrise. But other things were on his mind too, "The gods know this month is not one for midnight travels...", he thought, and it wasn't, not even for him. But first things first - alcohol. He stabled his dark brown mare on its own litle inn by the side of Camelot. The other horses didn't appreciate the nuisance, everything was restless in this heavy night of no moons. He felt worried about his own mount and a small prayer produced in his mind "Fucking fairy month, let them steal any other horse but mine" - thus blessing the mare against all misfortunes (at least in his heart). As he walked towards the heavy wooden doors, laughter showered him, followed by the click clacking of glasses, the tune of a lute and his player's voice, accompanied by an orchestra of roaring fires and crackling wood. Grant pushed hard against the doors. Above them, under torch light read in big red and blue wooden letters "Camelot's Table". 

A circus was, apparently, in town. Quite literally - it was right inside the tavern. Grant, having stepped in, was instantly involved by a clearer version of the tavern's insides - "Au!" he complained after a dressed monkey stomped his toes. It was followed by two other onomatopoeis and the responsible monkeys. These were wearing sailor hats and held eachothers hands. The monkeys jumped on a round wooden table while its human occupants protested jokingly, throwing ale and slapping the table while keeping a reasonable nervous distance from the animals. These baboons were followed by a person dressed in a tight green body-piece. She also stepped over Grant. She ran behind the monkeys while immitating them by pursing her shiny lips and scratching her harmpits. "Well, that's a lot of tavern to be stepping over my fucking feet", Grant reflected over the fact that the whole ground floor of the inn was, in fact, the tavern. He saw the bard playing on a small stage infront of five full tables where mostly crooked man sat in admiration. These seemed enchanted by the bards soothing love song about a prince and his so much desired princess, who obviously already had her hand promised to someone else, probably unworthy, older, smelly and ugly ofcourse. Their enchatement leaped into a surprise when two circus people jumped on to the stage. Their surprise burst into laughter when one of these clowns pretended to be the bard by mimmicking his every move, including pretending to be sitting on a chair - that is, after trying to sit on the bardÂ´s lap. He mimmicked and exaggerated the bards facial expressions while his colleague attempted to balance anything he could find about the stage and surrounding tables on the mime's head and limbs. The real bard pushed forth, trying his best to transmit the melancholy and faitfulnuss of his song, hopefuly overtaking the comedic act unfolding over his own. Grant cracked a smile at the perverse scenario.
