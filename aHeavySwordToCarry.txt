PROLOGUE - A HEAVY SWORD TO CARRY

"Zzzzzshhhhhhghrr" Grant's long sword echoed across the field as it dragged over inanimate things and pierced the earth - "cling!" it sounded, as it found a broken bronze helm still attached to its head - only recognizable thanks to the helm - a dented thing with the house of its wearer, a simple oak, carved into it on iron. The sound scared nearby crows that were picking on the rags of mulled man. The first bird and the easiest to frighten set off cawing, after it followed its band flying up through the smog and complaining aloud annoyed at the lost of nutritious potential. It seemed like a loud night falling upwards had covered the gray skies and as if for a moment everything had simply been an awful nightmare.
 
 At the top of the beaten smoking hill sat the warlord. The banner of his country sprawl open at the winds like a massive wing. In it a powerful elk embroidered in royal blue took the center of the flag with its front vigorous legs in the air and green emeralds shinning in the place of its eyes. Five gold stars hang in front of the beast, one for each castle in the kings realm. Elric's long black curls hang bellow his untouched gold platted armored shoulders. These, along with his straight head formed a proud arrow that pointed towards the sky - the only thing above him now. He barely moved in his massive battle wagon where he sat in a small wooden tower overseeing the remains of the battlefield. The view was scarred with corpses, mud and broken things. To an observer, the King seemed too calm, almost dormant, specially since he had just won the battle that gave him the war. 
 
 After this day the country was unified again under the crown, the rebellion having been finally vanquished. Children would sing songs in Elrics name and he would be written on the right side of history books. But something more pressing filled Elric's mind - he wouldn't be the only one written on the pages of history and tongues of story. The warlord pointed his sharp blue eyes slowly as he followed the target responsible for his victory that morning. But instead of pride or relief at the sight of his hero, alive and standing, Elrics expression was one of caution - someone else would've shown fear after seeing what Grant did during that battle, but Elric was a king and a king shows no fear. 
 
 It was known only in tales. The ones grandmothers tell to their grandchildren at lunch. Grandmothers have a different hunger from their small heirs, but equally big in appetite. They seem to feed on children's imagination, the stuff which dreams are made of, where immortality lays. These tales have many aperitifs that spread through the meal and taste of different memories, but somehow always come back to the main course, the story thus proceeding. And if one is lucky, if the child's imagination is running wild like fire and the story teller is a mature worthsmith, an ending with a flourish like fireworks in a dark night should be served as desert. And this fortunately is such a tale. One that everyone in the kingdom should know from their merry child years. About warriors who had been chosen by the gods - or as it was usually put - touched. The stories tell of brave honorable fighters who at some point during an important battle revealed powerful magical gifts never before seen or felt by the warriors themselves. Some spit fire, others froze every enemy they touched, some gained the strength of 10 elephants and the agility of a cheetah - whatever the skill, the warrior would involuntarily win the battle. Like William the Darthpoint, who's arrows would fly through whole legions before stopping, or Elban The Mighty Roar who's war cry would send his enemies into madness and fright, unleashing chaos and confusion behind enemy lines. But this wasn't a recent tale. They were known. There were old paintings that hung in royal halls, crafted by hands long gone about such stories portraying such heroes. And Elric knew them. Although he could not admit it, the cold sweat that permeated his unsoiled hands, the panic that had installed in his noble bowels after witnessing Grant, after living through a myth and all the bloodshed, they told him that he felt fear form Grant and that wouldn't do or he did not hold the kingdom's crimson crown over his head.   
 
As he dragged his tired sword across death, Grant caught a glimpse of a dandelion seed. It swam through the cold northern breeze and now he saw it, cherishing the moment as if it was his own life he was witnessing. He almost didn't notice it happening. But he did and his eyes shattered in a dozen glassy drops reflecting the surrounding destruction, rough tears that hit the ground hard, like lifeless bodies. If it wasn't for that spore, that drop of fleeting life that hang on with all its purpose to some line of potentiality, thin but heavy as the world, he wouldn't have remembered all the people he just erased and that he himself might have died. It might have never happened, but for him, the possibility of it was a miracle - his whole existence fell to his feet and buried itself along with the seeds that never were, might be and would be, soon, beautiful sunny dandelions, coming down floating on the winter winds of the north. Grant caught Elrics eyes, a lion staring at an eagle, high on its royal nest, and he knew then that he would never be able to lift his sword for the warlord again, or in any war for that matter. While he eyes Elric, his king, Grant wiped his red eyes, then his red sword on his cape and sheathed his powerful long sword for the last time on its holster. 

Night had settled and a cold mist involved the camp tents. Small fires that offered a big comfort permeated the field between large shared bulky tents. Tired warriors, now veterans, all of them, spoke above the fires over pig sausages, dry bread and dark cold ale. 

"For the last time, can someone please give me the jar or fill my cup? I ain't askin another time." Peter didn't stop his voice while handing, almost throwing, the jar at George " - I am telling you the king is going to promote him from Phalange leader to fucking Head of Joint - No! Hand, they'll make him a fucking Hand! What a hero man - our own Phalanger". He was very excited. While George poured himself more ale from the clay jar he let himself whisper mindlessly "I saw sir Grant slash a complete line of hundreds of full armored riders and their mounts with his sword. Just a sword". 
"You're spilling, man! Good ale by the way and not enough as it is, you know that." Robert, the oldest of the group, yelled from his tree stump where he sat slapping his thigh. George wiped the golden liquid from his trousers with a swift hand making an angry face. "And you should be glad about it." Robert continued "Sir Grant won us the war of the century, maybe of our millennium. I don't know about you George, but I want to go home. Enough with the damned insurgents and their Blockist ideas, they've brought enough death with their opinions as it is, to our people and our country. I say let them rot." A long pause followed, sullen with heavy echoes and heavier consciouses. Until Robert smirked, pulling on his beard "I also have a wife mind you. And I don't want her to turn into a scabbardita - you know what happens to the mind of a fisherwoman who's not seen a man for too long. The sea turns holes into pillars and pillars into holes. Besides, what you witnessed has its place in tales, gods damn me. It's a miracle and he should be awarded for it." Robert finished his sentence looking straight into the blazing flames, his bread dripping the sausage grease on the dark earth. Remembering what they saw made his words of praise fall from a stout and droopy mouth. 

His leg was shaking when a big heavy hand fell on his shoulder and brought him back to reality. It was a warm hand that grasped him with friendship and nostalgia.
"Sir Grant!" Robert managed to say while turning and saluting his Phalange Commander by reflex. Others that sat around the fire copied Roberts instinct.  "Relax Robert. All of you commoners, relax." Grant scratched at his nape "I am no longer your Commander so don't." He wore a tired smile "Mind if I sit?" He asked as he sat "I bring juice from the high tables, so throw the piss your drinking there, where piss belongs" He said emptying the clay jar himself onto a bush behind Robert and filling it from a big metallic jug. Everyone was silent but restless while Grant filled everyone's cup from the clay jar and drank directly from the metallic jug himself. Peter finally broke the silence with over excited words that fell from his mouth awkwardly loud "Were you promoted to Hand of the army?" - Robert immediately slapped Peter hard on the back of the head "Au!" Peter argued to which Robert answered "What the fuck boy, address Sir Grant properly!" Robert's face flushed red and Grant spit the wine he was drinking in a burst of laughter. Robert slithered from closed teeth in Peter's ear "What is the matter with you? Have you finally shat the small amount of wits y'ere born with?" "Robert you might have dislodged his head man. Are you alive boy? Pronounce your name, a little softer this time, please." Peter was still rubbing his head and gasping for air when he managed to answer "I am peter. I mean my name is. Sir! Sir Grant!" with emphasis on the <<sir's>>. Peter eyed Robert with fiery eyes while he spoke "Have you, Sir Grant, ex commander of our Phalange, been commended to a higher rank, sir?" Robert eyed him back in equal manner "I do not suppose that after your deeds in todays battle, that you haven't been promoted... Sir!" " Well, Peter, as a matter of fact I have." Grant opened his arms towards the camp. "I am now Hand. Leader of all these dogs. Commoners, Epics, Phalange groups, Carpals, Joints and all that shit. I have been endowed with the titles of Hero and Rare, even martyr, although I live... <<Hyuch>>, depending on the kings little fingers of course" he said in a whisper to himself and hiccuped again. What happened next caught Grant by surprise albeit his drunkenness. He almost cried although no one would ever know that, not even sober Grant. George knelled, then Robert did the same and after him everyone else knelled. Without a word, first the soldiers around the fire then soldiers walking by and then further - soon most of the camp was kneeling - some didn't even know why. Each unsheathed their weapons, stabbed them in the earth if they had a pointy part or simply laid these before themselves otherwise, head bowed down in respect. All paid allegiance to him, some to his power and most of them to the Hand. Grant let himself fall back onto the broken tree stump. The jug was still under his hard grip and it was shinning the light from the fire everywhere. Small stones smiled and glitter filled Grants eyes as he looked down. His other hand mimicked his thoughts by grabbing his long swords pommel. A woman - no, a girl - couldn't be older than 16 from her tender face and silky skin, was among the first of a column of rebels that tried to flank Grant's Phalange. Grant's Carpal General failed to predict this and so there was no counter-attack, no fluid repositioning of the army, no reaction. Just some people, the ones at the front, yelling obscenities as they could only but look at their upcoming doom. Grant was staring straight in that rebel girls eyes when it happened. It started as an excited heat filling his ribcage. Thinking of it now made him feel it again - or was it the other way around? The thought scared his drunk self. The heat spread through his stomach and then his mind was loose. Like a fish leaping out of dense blue water and glimpsing at the outside world for the first time - Grant felt a power that was not his or of anyone mortal. His muscles were capable of moving mountains and had but his feeble meat to propel and his sword - craftsmanship, yes, but a simple piece of metal, felt gigantic and a continuation of his hand. Her eyes were so close now that Grant could've spoken to her, tell her to run, or to get down, but instead his hand moved and with it the long sword. The slash was so great that perhaps thousands fell from it, either dead or dying. The first hundreds of people had been split into bits and pieces as the sword moved through them as if through mint. A couple more slashes and the earth was red and the battle won. Grant was dripping from his rivals gore as his brothers and sisters in arms thanked him and hailed him a hero, but the truth was that he had had no choice. What broke Grant was the math - he couldn't fadom how many he had slaughtered. And the ones he could were still too many to make a difference - he only had one face - that first girl who eyed him with her child eyes - she was the one he asked forgiveness every night from that day forward. 
  

It was a cold night outside of The Round Table where the finest ale in town was served. It was also the only inn ever built in the spell hunted town of Brimswoods. Made from enchanted green apples and milky beechwood honey - ingredients grown in the woods surrounding the inn and its tavern - the ale was sweet and mistakenly light to the palate for it kicked like a mule. Some say it would even make you hallucinate fantastic things if you drank enough of it without summoning it back up again. Regardless of the brew, the town's night owls, travelers, drunks and vagabonds seemed to have gravitated towards each other, perhaps for fear, perhaps for celebration, and together ended up at the tavern in that magical holiday night of no moons.

The town was an old one. It had been governed by different lords across time and the townspeople were used to passing things - they were nostalgic but disconnected. Being the greenest patch of land of a southern Port country it was very desirable and searched for. Ships and traders passed through it constantly as did their languages and costumes. Its rich coast line and sea bursting with fish as well as extensive fields of fertile land ready to birth fat crops were the bread and butter of the townspeople. The woman were mainly fishers and man usually worked the fields, both were relaxed and easy going. The timber, oceans of trees that diffused into rivers of forests whose arms extended through the land profusely, was dark brown outside but inside a rare purple hue spiraled through it, making it very popular for building furniture among nobility from far away lands. The current family that received the town's taxes was the Bricks. They came to power through marriage - their youngest daughter paired with the eldest duke from the Stone family, the previous family that received the towns taxes and protected them against unprecedented threats that never came. The towns most wanted crop was a drug, a mild tranquilizer that the farm hands relished in their teas, the fisherwoman smoked in their purple wood pipes and foreign powers wanted to keep out of their borders while their rulers stashed full coffers the size of houses with it, enjoying its effects wholeheartedly. All the lords knew the plant's humble tale that had its origin in Brimswoods and everyone told some version of it - there once was a poor man that watered his crops with sea water. Everyone in town called him crazy-leg, not because he was crippled, although he was, but because they thought him crazy - you see, the gossip was that he had drank a little bit too much of the ocean he used to water his hypothetical plants. These never grew of course, because of the salt in the water. One day, old crazy-leg woke up in the middle of the night. The wind whistled at his wooden door and rain knocked at his windows and a loud weep creped into his ears. He limped out of bed, and since his house was but a room he couldn't avoid staring at the black door. The weeping got louder at times, coming in bursts, filling him with chills. Old crazy-leg lit his night candle and then with it a cigarette he always kept on his night stand to help with his nerves and continued the limping towards his door, the weeping now sounding more like a saw brushing over some metal, lifted his skin making him feel like a cold chicken. He finished the rest of his cigarette with one deep drag and on its numbing nicotine he opened the door. A baby stared back at him from a white pillow deep from a straw basket. The water had not got to the baby yet. Old crazy-leg brought the baby inside and when he saw a note attached to the babies pajamas he threw it in a drawer - for he could not read, but since we can - the note said "Dear Willies, you might not remember me for like me the port holds many and I suppose you've seen most of them (from what I hear). Well, I cannot keep this baby for I am dying. And since half of it belongs to you I hope that you take her and care for her. I am sorry. Livia". The baby  was named Hope and Hope grew into a beautiful girl old enough to marry, and married she was by very Old crazy-leg, or as he was known in the brothels - Willies - he arranged her to marry the horse master's son - Bert, who's father was his Willies cousin. Old crippled Willies was getting too old now but his scientific endeavor still rushed through him like lightning. He would prove everyone wrong even if it killed him - he was going to show that sea water could grow crops, in fact, the best crops of all. One beautiful summer morning, when Willies was very sick and dying in his small wooden room that smelled of the sea, his daughter and her husband were desperately searching for some seed, any seed, in the hopes of bringing some rest to very old Willies. They searched the whole house for one until Hope stumbled upon something ancient made of now darkened straws - it was her old baby basket - old Willies had kept it all this time. She hugged the now yellow pillow and cried a little. Beneath it she found three seeds - golden and shinny yelling for her attention. She put them in her dress pocket and ran out to the field. With her slender white fingers she pierced the brown warm earth and one by one she placed the seeds in under a brilliant midday sun shinning over her. When she was done Bert hugged her making Hope cry again, her tears hit the three seeds. And involved by her salty water the seeds immediately grew out of the ground, green and strong with the bluest flowers she had ever seen. Bert and Hope rushed inside, picked old Willies up and limped him outside to see his dream come true and Old crazy-crippled died with a smile right there and then as the waves danced softly with the shore before them. 

Grant pulled softly on his jenny and stopped amid the muddy road leading to the town's center.  It had been raining every other day, softly and slowly, gently nurturing the ground. With every step, Grants donkey - who he called simply donkey thus naming it so, would sink a little bellow ground level which must have been very frustrating, wet and dirty. Grant stared at the squishy ground and mindlessly imagined his mounts mind. Something darker than the black earth slowly came into his view. His eyes not knowing what to do with the small detail amongst the debree and surrounding misty darkness, they ignored it. "Do you think horse thoughts I wonder - no. You're so much calmer than a horse." He spoke outloud now, getting carried away by the sudden realization that his four-legged friend and companion was making conversation with him, albeit it being in the form of his own voice. "You're smar - no - dumber. Ah it's quite alright. You are what you are and I'll take care of you as long as you take care of my travels." He patted her with a wry smile. A black hare's foot. The image rendered in his minds eye now - he turned  to look back - there was no hare, only a foot. It was neatly  placed on the center of the road Grant had been following - now behind them, the leg was clean and above ground as well - freshly done? Like a towering lighthouse illuminating the dark shores of a wild sea at night, Grant lifted his big head snugged in his bright yellow hood and turned it back to its right place - facing forwards. He was sleepy and in the middle of a crossroad and to be frank didn't much care for hares and their foots - "at the moment they can go down the hares hole by themselves... Or was it rabbit's hole? Do hares have holes at all?!" He stopped his donkey and they both stared. In the middle of the circle a lamp post stood shining light from its oily entrails. The post was painted bright red - in fact it still dripped paint - and it only, just quite by chance, managed to illuminate the circle and its wooden arrows. To his right stood The Round Table and in it his eyes saw the promise of a smoothing fugue. He could see the building at the end of the road, proving that the wooden arrow with its blue and red aged paint were not liars. To his left a "school" probably stood, as per indicated in dry flaky black paint on an old wooden arrow sign - although he couldn't really see it in the surrounding darkness, and a "circus", or so the sign promised, in stripes, blue and yellow, freshly painted under "school".  So fresh it was that the responsible brush was still present, hovering next to the sign, dripping fat paint drops on the mud. A small old looking man held said paintbrush with one steady hand, pinky afloat. Grant stared at the smiling man from across the circle where the roads connected as he stared back at Grant and then the smiling painter spoke.

"Heydi hidihidihi shall I help you work your way stranger or should I trust that you can read letters and numbers with'yer own mind fella?"

"I can read very well thank you old man. Is what you paint true? Or have I just caught you, hand in honey?" The wrinkly old man wailed a forced quick laugh, putting his free hand on his belly.

"I'ma sorry, boy, but I am not of these parts - do you call painters honyers or something of the sort around these ways? Or is this a saying, an old interpretation, as they say? I am Bruno, and I work for the circus, you see?"  He pointed the brush at the sign he painted himself, it was a wonderful art piece in its own right - has he unveiled his identity Bruno waved the brush back and forth, splashing paint in all sorts of manners. "I travel with them and for one silver you can enjoy a show and see that I speak the truth, just come with me in the arrows direction fella - I am sorry, I did not mean to presume you can read directions as well! In any event, I can promise you that there is one going on as I speak and you listen!" He giggled and pulled his undergarments to cover his tush again - they started falling almost immediately. Grant was so tired that as Bruno spoke he almost forgot the old man was speaking, or that he was real for that matter, because of this he only really heard the last sentence or so. 

"Old man, I am not in the mood for kicking you nor am I in the mood to be taken as a fool and be robbed of my belongings, you understand?" He tapped his sword's pommel with a thick index finger so that Bruno knew he meant it.

"Sir, I am but a fool, a circus painter and a joker - do not take my tone to be an insult now! I entertain, that is all..." As he explained and gesticulated, Bruno also walked the circle's circumference in the direction of the other arrow - Grant did the reverse so that he maintained the same distance from the old jester. "Listen, I can see I have hurt your feelings, allow me to simply give you one free pass, uh? What say you? But just this once! I can assure you that no circus will be coming this way in quite some time, nor as great as ours either..."

Grant rolled his eyes and sighted a tired sigh. 
"Now, why would there be a circus show at this time of night?"
"Why, we show ourselves in our shows at every hour of the day kind sir, of course, different ones." 

"With malice crawling in every direction from its black hole, where it hides from daylight, as it too often does at this time of night Bruno?"

"Well -" Bruno leaned an elbow on the Round Table arrow as he was cut off by Grant.
 
"I say you lie! But I do not care so much as to interject in your dwellings - simply leave me be and I'll grant you the same gratitude old man."

"I am not as old as I look although I am older than I speak to be and sound, on ears, younger and older than myself and that I am to know myself to be." Bruno bowed after this gibberish and continued to walk the other half of the circle, as Grant did the same, both finishing back at their starting arrows. 

"Dui" Grant said without looking back at Bruno as he headed towards the inn. 

"The pleasure was all yours - AND DO SAY HELLO...!" at this point Grant was already riding away, but Bruno continued as much as for Grant as for himself "to my circus friends who are resting there, and you are surely bound to meet and love hidihidihi".

  As Grant launched himself, lured by the still distant sounds of leisure and rest that streamed from the inn and its wooden comfort, he smiled a rare smile. He had been looking for alcohol, a place to rest his tired mount and another, preferably different, to rest himself, so that he could forget about his big heavy body until sunrise. Then he would sell his amulets at the town's market as he had often done through the towns he passed. Magical amulets that he acquired through perfectly legal means, of course, but don't ask him twice about that. Other things were on his mind too, "It's fucking cold outside" as well as "the gods made this day not one for midnight travels...", and it wasn't, not even for him. Arriving at the torch lit house, he stabled his dark brown jenny on its own little inn by the side of The Round Table. The other horses didn't appreciate the nuisance, everything was restless in this dense night. He felt worried about his own mount and a small prayer produced in his mind "Fucking fairy month, let them steal one of the horses if they must and leave my jenny be" - thus blessing the mare against all misfortunes, at least in his heart. As he walked towards the heavy wooden doors, laughter showered him, followed by the click clacking of glasses, the tune of a lute and his player's voice, accompanied by an orchestra of roaring fires and crackling wood. Grant pushed hard against the doors. Above them, under torch light read in big red and blue wooden letters "The Round Table".


Grant, having stepped in, was instantly involved by the tavern's insides - "Au!" was the first thing out of his big mouth, after a dressed monkey stomped his toes. A circus was in town and had clowned its way right inside the tavern. His yell was followed by two other onomatopoeias and their causal monkeys. These were wearing fisherwoman hats and held each others hands. The monkeys jumped on a round oak table and a senseless argument among the occupants and the monkeys ensued. These baboons were followed by a person dressed in a tight green body-piece decorated witch red squares. She also stepped over Grant. She ran behind the monkeys while imitating them by pursing her shiny lips and scratching her armpits. "Well, that's a lot of tavern to be stepping over my fucking feet", Grant burst out loud only to have his words drown in the sea of sound that filled the tavern in volume. As he traced the clowns with his weary dark eyes he reflected over the fact that the whole ground floor of the inn was, in fact, the tavern. He saw the bard playing on a small stage in front of five full tables where mostly crooked people sat in admiration. These seemed enchanted by the bards soothing love song about a prince and his so much desired princess, who obviously already had her hand promised to someone else, probably unworthy, older, smellier and uglier than the prince by an unmeasurable degree. Their enchantment leaped into a surprise when two circus people landed on the stage. Their surprise burst into laughter when one of these mimes pretended to be the bard by mimicking his every move, including sitting on an invisible chair - that is, after trying to sit on the bard´s lap. He mimicked and exaggerated the bards facial expressions while his colleague attempted to balance anything he could find about the stage and surrounding tables on the mime's head and limbs. The real bard pushed forth, trying his best to transmit the melancholy and faithfulness of his song, hopefully overtaking the comedic act unfolding over his own. Grant cracked a smile at the perverse scenario forgetting about his toes and pushed his way towards the bar. The whole inn smelled like buttery popcorn even though there wasn't any. As he was getting ready to interact with the bartender a man burst through the door armed with a bow and arrow wearing a green suit and a pointy hat with a red feather sticking out of it - "Where are you my lady!? I shall defeat the beasts who took you from me! Have no fear my pearl, for I - Nibor Doow, prince of the castles - have arrived, and I own so many many castles". 

Behind the bar was Camelot, a bear of a woman and the owner of The Round Table. She saw Grant approaching while she served ale - "Hoi stranger, what can I get ya? Never mind the silly goons".
Grant, wanting to be heard over the music and the crowded voices, pulled his yellow hood back and yelled huskily "Hoi miss, get me fists of yer best ale, enough to drown me in peace" - "you're in light, that's the only ale we have - the best. And enough to drown a whale or two as well." 
"That is grand! Take'em to the game table will ya? That is, if you have one."  
"The best in Brimswoods as well - two shields per ale and one crown for sitten mid-game, yes? There's three old dogs and two bitches goen at it already" she said while walking around the oak counter filled with drunks, "Follow my ass, but don't stare at it cause I'll feel it you cheeky bastard." She smiled with her round face and tapped her pointy nose on the side. The remark made him jolly even before the ale. The counter went for half the length of the room, stools filling it with noisy, lively people. The small stage had a couched chair where the bard sat at the center of the room - its legs worked into ivory and flowers, the chair was the most expensive item in the whole inn Grant thought.

"Sssssun!" an arrow flew over Grants head. Nibor Doow was shooting arrows across the room until he finally hit his target. The green lady who pretended to be a monkey gave a sharp yell, a twist and a theatrical flip followed by an ugly face and "STUMP" it sounded as she hit the boarded floor. "Ahah! I've got one of you monsters! Fear me now!" he yelled as he leaped forward and embarrassed one of the baboons, confusing it for his princess. "Worry not and cry no longer my clam, for I have saved you! And you'll have so many castles, one for each color of the rainbow!" the monkey kissed him on the lips and everybody laughed. "Do these cunts even know what night it is today?" - Camelot looked back at Grant's incredulous face while his body squeezed through tables "Ups, excuse me - uh - behen'ya. Well, they do - Ugh, sorry - that's why they are here and drunk. For protection."
Grant looked at Camelots butt to test an hypothesis he had - perhaps she wasn't a witch after all - and followed her to the game table. To get there they had to walk towards the furthest fireplace which sat in the far most corner of the room. On their way Grant saw an enormous man laughing very hard, looking like a red balloon, full and ready to burst - his table friends howled and cried, hitting the table and each other in hopes to cease their laughing attack. Another table, three bearded woman sat in a triangle and stared at Grant as he passed by, having stopped their words abruptly - "BANG!" Grant looked back at the sound of broken wood and saw the big man rolling on the floor - now laughing purple. A shrimp that had been lodged in his throat but had been expelled by his abrupt fall now laid on his forehead. Camelot's butt pushed a full grown man right out of his seat and onto the floor. "Oh by the gods, let me help yup fella" she turned at Grant while she helped the confused man up - "I done know where ye're from, but around here drinken is our way of avoiden the little bitches miasmes. It worked for ma granda and it sure works for the folk now." Grant grunted. It was a fucked up night. People died often. Not many, but Grant knew about it even though he was not from Brimswoods. At the moment, he wasn't from anywhere really, but it was all the same to him. At least the Inn was merry. 

At the counter, very merry indeed, sat an old wizard. No one knew he was a wizard and he wanted to keep it that way. His name was Leopoldino of Schrödinger the Feynman. But everyone knew him by Leopold and that he did not mind, for the name of a wizard is quite a powerful thing in the right hands and thrice as powerful in the wrong ones. The magician had more deeper and pungent secrets to keep as well - he put these in two boxes: one at his heart and the other in his head.  Apart from himself, only a child and his mother had the keys to these boxes as old tradition and sound practice advises. In this specially dark night, much like in every other moon washed night before it, Leopold was sitting at the bar and telling jokes to whoever sat near by, even if just to himself - he didn't mind, and in fact sometimes it was preferable for he was such a good listener and smart as well, so no small detail or reference was wasted on him. 
He was drunk, of course, and his black velvet cape glittered in the fire light like a thousand galaxies dripping from the milky way. It would have tasted like honey if the eye had palate. 
"What does a Jew, a catholic priest and a movie director have in common?" Leopoldino's cheeks were red as apples. As usual, the drunks who sat at the counter with him answered the question with another question - all other people gasped at the never ending interruptions that made Leopoldino's jokes funny for all the wrong reasons.
"Wait, a jew? What does that mean? Is that somethin people do?"

"A name? No, it is a person for the heavenly library's sake."
"Oh easy man, don'go on summonin the scribin programmers for notin'. So, a Jew is a person then? Like a name o' somon?"
"No, the word 'Jew' is a diminutive of the word Jewish - indicating the person's faith, which comes from the word 'Judaism' - the religion." - hiccup - "Like, like.. Like, you who probably believes in your gods of potatoes and water? Well, they believe in a singular creator and all of that mess - but moving on. What do you think they -"
"So, wait, wait, a different faith!? But ther' only be the three gods or may the great ant Tree of Erin strike me down! What be you speakin!"
"..."
"And, wait, wait, wait..." - another said with a beginners enthusiasm and confidence - "What is a 'catoholic' then? Don tell me it is a person who gets drunk on cats? I knew ye'd get sick if they poo on ye but drunk!?" Leopoldino's smile dropped to a frown and everybody laughed explosive laughs. Droplets flew through the inn like helium balloons at a child's party.
"You know what? I am done! With, with, with... With all of you!" - hiccup - "All different but equally the same! You are written and drawn by the same heavy shaky hand." Leopold said while enacting this with his own hand. "You only possess different faces, one uglier than the next, because the hand quavered so much. You're all iterations of the same biographical self portrait of poo! Now leave me drink my drink and you drink yours or I'll do it for you." Leopold turned fast, straightening his cape by pulling it out from under his bottom and frowned solemnly at his dark golden drink that fizzed in a thick quartz crystal beer stein. The lid was ornamented with little silver cherubs that held its tip as if ready to lift it or close it at their master's command - this was his own personal stein which he proudly kept at the inn for presentation purposes. Everyone else drank from either glass or dark yellow porcelain steins and mugs. His pressed hard on the shinny wood counter and everyone surrounding Leopold continued their long laugh having managed the funniest joke out of him - to make him miserably annoyed. 

Exactly on the other side of the room, sitting at the round granite table, Grant was accompanied by two fisherwomen. They were passing and puffing on a purple wooden pipe and sat with their legs crossed. Their toasted skin kissed by the sun revealed their trade immediately to Grant, although their way with words would've done this as well - fisherwoman were gifted with explicitness and nimbleness in their language - a good laugh could last minutes and stay with you for days or make you shiver and hide in your shell like an hermit crab.
"...Regina was her name. That lobster licker, I tell you I haven't had that much fun in high sea since - "
"Shht! Yer husband Junia! He's right there!" Junia who was in her late 70's turned back so quickly that she almost fell off her chair. Her husband was, of course, not behind her. In fact her husband had been dead for years now and she was mostly fine with that, but sometimes she had to be reminded of it.
She turned back towards her fisher friend slowly and spoke from under a smiling grin: 
"Oh you sea cow! Yer seeing ghosts aren't ye then?" Junia's insult just made Sophia's laugh more cheerfully. She smacked Junia's old wrinkly leg like an old mate would and apologized.
"Continue then, I love your stories of younger times, chasing for those skirt-mussels. I won't stop'ya no more, promise on old Burt's skinny soul".  Junia lit the pipe with a match, slowly, and puffed a few times from it. A rich lavender cloud immersed her amber lit face and soon the whole table was involved in deep smog. Deeper crevices filled her face with heaviness. Like rivers flowing towards two blue seas, her eyes pulled you in through those chasmic tracks of old.
"You scabbardita, yer just jealous of not having known my coral pussy in its golden age -".
"Scented of ripe sea bas it did, likely, likely" Sophia interjected.
" - a pinch of salt, olive oil and potatoes and you got yourself a kings meal!" Junia completed. 
"Yeah, yeah, truly a Milena, weren't ya? Move on!"  
"Fuck, where was I? ... Regina! Yes. She had been smokin too much of these happy flowers and on that night, when she walked home, she heard an elder tree. It was tellin her to penetrate into it! By the gods, like all'ya boys want to do to me, you see! Well, like ye fellas, she wasn't right of mind. She climbed in it through a hole big enough to fit an orgy of squirrels. And then the bitch was so gone that she fell asleep in there! Old Pattrick happened to be walkin nearby, on his way to the apple market or something stupid like that and heard her screams. He had to hack her out of it with his ripe arms and sharp axes. She was on a fit for weeks! You explain that then boy."

"Well miss... I don know bout no speakin trees. But I figure I just take it too be true either way - for if the gods can strike me if I don and I can be struck if I do, I'll just take it to be on their side..." The young farmer muttered mostly to himself. 
"Hoi Ron, ye fish-head, the gods shall smack ye indeed if ye go on playin games like that!" Junia was getting closer to Ron as she spoke.
"They might very well have put me her just to pound on ya myself, if yer lucky enough!".
And then, as if the gods were on his side (although not soon enough for Regina's breath had already lodged itself in his nose), the waiter, a boy of 16, as skinny as he was beautiful of face, dropped ale on Grant's lap - farmer Ron had, unbeknownst to him, tripped the poor waiter with his foot. Grant didn't much care, he was drunk, thinking of bed sheets and how Sophia had already meet his eyes more times than chance warrants. But she, the youngest fisherwoman, reacted from instinct and the words raced ahead of her thoughts and it was as if the waiter had dropped boiling soup over her child. 
"Oh you shit-ricker! Are you farm hand then? Pay attention to yer job hey? I should make ye dance atop the sharks naked and stupid with fear, maybe then ye learn how to fucking walk hey?" 
The boy was as red as he was ashamed and more nervous still. With pure intent he procceeded with a blurry action: to awkwardly clean Grant's groin, a veteran warrior. This, although not disclosed by him, was but predictable (the giant man carried a long sword on his back) as was what followed. With a grey harsh towel, the waiter carried his reflex as the consequence to the mess he had done - even if not through his fault when Grant, also acting from deadly reflex pushed the boys hand away from his private parts with enough violance for the waiter to fear for his life and his families.
"What the fuck boy?!" Grant jumped up from his chair, as he barked at the boy. And although not clear to anyone else but himself, almost fainted from getting up so fast.
"Oh by the gods, I am sorry! Please sir!!" The boy pledged, curling up after Grant had thrown him to the ground. The surrounding inn seemed to stop - onlookers being empathetically terrified for the boy. Camelot had seen the whole ordeal from behind the bar. She held a small loaded crossbow under the counter. Although Grant never knew, she would have nailed Grants hand to the wall even before he had considered grabbing his sword.
"It's uh, it's okay, just leave it" Reality took a little longer to reach Grant than it did for everyone else. He felt Sophia holding back his arm, not that he was planning on using it. She looked tiny now that he standed, towering over the table. He looked back at her and slowly lifted her small hand from his forearm, thick like a bulls, and picked the boy up on his feet by the shoulders, speaking as he cleaned the dust from the waiter's clothes - "I mean no arm boy, don't be scared now." He recoiled "Oh common, you're fine. Just give me that ragged thing and bring me another one yeah?"
"On the house sir, yes, yes..."
"I mean a towel, but sure, that too."
As the boy left the oldest fisherwoman spoke, loud so that the waiter could still hear her.
"I have a son and if I ever doubted he was a dick licker I'd send his ass while it was still tight to the high seas, together with the ladies. Grabbing a men like that. Uh. A month or two as the only stick a'board and they'd cling to him like limpets cling to hard rock. The boy'd come back straighter than a board." This somehow lightened up the table. 
Sophia, still shaken, asked Junia while sitting.
"Yer think is that Willie's boy's gay? Nah, he's too pretty for that! The girls wouldn't let him."
And for the first time the fifth player at the table, a man in a suit, spoke. Grant's eyes meet Sophia's for the dozenth time, they seem to say "ups". 
"Well woman, whatever he is, what we can admit is that it is some sort of hallucinatory state - those that you know well, from hitting that pipe." He smiled from under his brow. 
"You envision yer own narrative and it clashes with his. But both of ya are locked and intertwined with these. Making you mere shadows and not people. No better than a dog or a concept. Unfinished, full of lost potential."
"I'll hit you with the hallucinatory pipe if ye don start makin sense ye bastard. What be yer name then?"
"My name is Mcthrow. And I mean no disrespect of course my lady."
"Well <<sir>> Mcthrow, I'll throw ye into the deep seas if ye attack me like that again, how about that? Yer not scared of fisherwoman's magic?"
"But lady Junia I am but arguing that you are a fisherwoman, and is that not the case?"
"Well, yes."
"Then, you admit to have taken this idea of a fisherwoman like a glass takes to water, shaping yerself according to the fisherwoman type. You have changed yer habits and learned the skills. Ye'er no longer just Junia who does what Junia does - you are Junia the fisherwoman, and therefore predictable for anyone who knows the fisherwoman type. Words are predictable, form and ways. Even thought."

"Well, it's a programming language that -"
"what do you mean by programming?"
"- Well... I mean what I said and what I meant by what I said is that you can define behavior through conditions in a very well constructed formal language. You see, logic -"
"No, I don' see it, ye're speakin in tongues man. What do you mean old man. Do you mean magik?"
"Well now, I'm older than I look -"
"And clever as a crow, but what ye're sellin me here for gold is just pebbles. Don' take me for a dumbwitt for I am a cat and I know when I have smelled a mouse. Now thread carefully man, explain yer'self"
"Okay, okay. Well now, Mr Feline, I'll try and make you pur."
"What?" 
"Listen then. What I am failing to enlighten you about is the nature of reality dear Bob."
"For the last times, my name is Petrie. Ye speak of the ether recipe..?"
"Exactly so, exactly so. Let me use then scripture, song and faith tales."
"That's what ye should'o'done in the first place!"
"Yes, yes - my fault old horse. In the great library - "
"Where tiles are inscribed with tales, and the shelves are long, fluid streams of gold!"
"..."
"You seem to know the tale quite well Bob."
"... Me ma taught me letter and number by it at the table when I was just a lil seed." He was ecstatic.
"Well then, a nice ma you had. Did she then tell you about the books on these shelves?"
"She needed not to - a library is full a books - that I knew and everybody knows - ya don'need to see one."
"Very good. But then let me tell you Bob - the ether recipe is written in those very books. Books that only one of the gods can read, and even that one needs glasses to do so. And in these books the letters and numbers are different from the ones your ma taught you Bob - these are written in the code of nature, the rules for how to make everything in the world Bob - the wielder of which can create anything - you see how library sounds very similar to liberty? This is why that is so."
"And if ye could read them ye could understand anything uh?"
"Anything Bob. And if you could write in them you could make anything become true as well! What would you write about Bob?"
"Gold and bitches me lord! All of them for me! Ahahahahah!" 
"Charming Bob"
"Hey, I told'ye, me'name's not Bob for fuck's sake, it is -"
"Petrie, yes yes. I know Bob, it's just an expression old horse. Gold and bitches, you'd be a poet if these were other times..."
