PROLOGUE - A HEAVY SWORD TO CARRY

"Zzzzzshhhhhhghrr" the long sword echoed across the field as it dragged piercing the earth - "cling!" it made, as it found a broken bronze helm still attached to a barely recognizable head. 
At the top of the beaten smoking hill sat a warlord. Elric's long black curls hang bellow his untouched shinny armoured shoulders. These, along with his straight head formed a proud arrow that pointed towards the sky - the only thing above him now. He barely moved in his battle wagon where he sat overseeing the remains of the battlefield. The view was scared with corpses, mud and broken things. Every tree had been cut down. The warlord pointed his sharp blue eyes slowly has he followed the target responsible for his victory that morning. But instead of pride or relief at the sight of his hero, alive and standing, Elrics expression was one of caution - someone else would've shown fear after seeing what Grant did during that battle. 
 
As he dragged his tired sword across death Grant caught a glimpse of a dandelion seed. It swam through the cold northern breeze and now he saw it, cherishing the moment as if it was his own life he was witnessing. He almost didn't notice it happening. But he did and his eyes shattered in a dozen glassy drops reflecting the surrounding destruction, rough tears that hit the ground hard like the bodies of his masters enemies had done just hours ago at the taste of his power. If it wasn't for that spore, that drop of fleeting life that hang on with all its purpose to some line of potentiality, thin but heavy as the world, he wouldn't have remembered that he might have died. And it might have never happened, but for him, the possibility of it was a miracle - his whole existence fell to his feet and buried itself along with the seeds that never were, might be and would be, soon, beautiful sunny dandelions, coming down floating on the winter winds of the north. Grant caught Elrics eyes, a lion staring at an eagle, high on its hunting nest, and he knew then that he would never be able to lift a sword for the warlord again.

BRIMSWOODS

It was a cold night outside of The Round Table where the finest ale in town was served. It was also the only inn ever built in the spellhunted town of Brimswoods. Made from enchanted green apples and milky beechwood honey - engredients grown in the woods surrounding the inn and its tavern - the ale was sweet and light but it kicked like a mule. Some say it could even make you hallucinate fantasticly terrible things. Regardless of the brew, the town's nightowls, travelers, drunks and vagabonds seemed to have gravitated towards eachother, perhaps for fear, perhaps for celebration, and together ended up at the tavern in that magical holiday night of no moons.

Grant, pulling softly on his mare, stoped amid the muddy road leading to the town's centre. He was in the middle of a crossroad. To his right stood The Round Table and in it his eyes saw the promise of a fugue. To his left a "school" probably stood, as per indicated in dried flacky brown paint on a wooden arrow sign - he couldn't really see it in the sorrounding darkness. And a "circus", or so it said in striped blue and yellow fresh paint. Lured by the still distant sounds of leisure that streamed from the inn and its wooden comfort, he rode towards it. He had been looking for alcohol, a place to rest his tired horse and another, preferably different, to rest himself, so that he could forget about his big heavy body until sunrise. Then he would sell his amulets at the town's market as he had often done through the towns he passed. Magical hamulets that he acquired through perfectly legal means, of course, but don't ask him twice about that. Other things were on his mind too, "It's fucking cold outside" as well as "the gods made this day not one for midnight travels...", and it wasn't, not even for him. So he rode towards the tourch lit house. He stabled his dark brown mare on its own litle inn by the side of The Round Table. The other horses didn't appreciate the nuisance, everything was restless in this dense night. He felt worried about his own mount and a small prayer produced in his mind "Fucking fairy month, let them steal any other horse but mine" - thus blessing the mare against all misfortunes, at least in his heart. As he walked towards the heavy wooden doors, laughter showered him, followed by the click clacking of glasses, the tune of a lute and his player's voice, accompanied by an orchestra of roaring fires and crackling wood. Grant pushed hard against the doors. Above them, under torch light read in big red and blue wooden letters "The Round Table".

 Grant, having stepped in, was instantly involved by a clearer version of the tavern's insides - "Au!" was the first thing out of his big mouth, after a dressed monkey stomped his toes. A circus was in town and had clowned its way right inside the tavern. His yell was followed by two other onomatopoeis and their causal monkeys. These were wearing sailor hats and held eachothers hands. The monkeys jumped on a round oak table and a senseless argument among the occupants and the monkeys ensued. These baboons were followed by a person dressed in a tight green body-piece decorated witch red squares. She also stepped over Grant. She ran behind the monkeys while immitating them by pursing her shiny lips and scratching her harmpits. "Well, that's a lot of tavern to be stepping over my fucking feet", Grant burst outloud, reflecting over the fact that the whole ground floor of the inn was, in fact, the tavern. He saw the bard playing on a small stage infront of five full tables where mostly crooked people sat in admiration. These seemed enchanted by the bards soothing love song about a prince and his so much desired princess, who obviously already had her hand promised to someone else, probably unworthy, older, smellier and uglier than the prince. Their enchatement leaped into a surprise when two circus people landed on the stage. Their surprise burst into laughter when one of these clowns pretended to be the bard by mimmicking his every move, including sitting on a chair - that is, after trying to sit on the bardÂ´s lap. He mimmicked and exaggerated the bards facial expressions while his colleague attempted to balance anything he could find about the stage and surrounding tables on the mime's head and limbs. The real bard pushed forth, trying his best to transmit the melancholy and faitfulnuss of his song, hopefuly overtaking the comedic act unfolding over his own. Grant cracked a smile at the perverse scenario and pushed his way towards the bar. The whole inn smelled like buttery popcorn even though there wasn't any. As he was getting ready to interact with the bartender a man burst through the door armed with a bow and arrow wearing a green suit and a pointy hat with a red feather sticking out of it - "Where are you my lady!? I shall defeat the beasts who took you from me! Have no fear my pearl, for I - Nibor Doow, prince of the castles - have arrived, and I own so many many castles". 

Behind the bar was Camelot, a bear of a woman and the owner of The Round Table. She saw Grant approaching while she served ale - "Hoi stranger, what can I get ya? Nevermind the silly goons".
Grant, wanting to be heard over the music and the crowded voices, pulled his yellow hood back and yelled huskly "Hoi miss, get me fists of yer best ale, enough that they'll drown me in peace" - "you're in light, that's the only ale we have - the best. And enough to drown a whale or two as well." 
"That is grand - but first, you do have a game table don't ya?"  
"The best in Brimswoods as well - two shields per ale and one crown for sitten mid-game, yes? There's three old dogs and two bitches goen at it already" she said while walking around the oak counter filled with drunks, "Follow my ass, but don't stare at it cause I'll feel it you cheeky bastard." She smiled with her round face and tapped her pointy nose on the side. The remark made him jolly even before the ale. The counter went for half the length of the room, stools filling it with noisy, lively people. The small stage had a couchened chair where the bard sat at the centre of the room - its legs worked into ivery and flowers, was the most expensive item in the whole inn Grant thought.

Nibor Doow was throwing arrows across the room until he finally hit something. The green monkey lady gave a sharp yell, a twist and a flip followed by an ugly face and "STUMP" it sounded as she hit the boarded floor. "Ahah! I've got one of you monsters! Fear me now!" he yelled as he leaped forward and embrassed one of the baboons. "Fear no longer my clam, for I have saved you!" the monkey kissed him on the lips and everybody laughed. "Do these cunts even know what night it is today?" - Camelot looked back at Grant's incredulous face while his body squeezed through tables "Ups, excuse me - uh - behen'ya. Well, they do - Ugh, sorry - that's why they are here and drunk. For protection."
Grant looked at Camelots butt to test an hypothesis he had - perhaps she wasn't a witch afterall - and followed her to the game table. To get there they had to walk towards the furthest fireplace which sat in the farmost corner of the room. On their way Grant saw an enoumous man laughing very hard, looking like a red baloon, full and ready to burst - his table friends howeled and cried, hiting the table and eachother in hopes to cease their laughing attack. Another table, three bearded woman sat in a triangle and stared at Grant as he passed by, having stoped their words abruptly - "BANG!" Grant looked back at the sound of broken wood and saw the man rolling on the floor - now laughing purple. A shrimp that had been lodged in his throat but had been expelled by his abrupt fall now laid on his forehead. Camelot's belly pushed a full grown man right out of his seat and onto the floor. "Oh my gods, let me help yup fella" she turned at Grant while she helped the confused man up - "I done know where ye're from, but around here drinken is our way of avoiden the little bitches miasmes. It worked for ma granda and it sure works for the folk now." Grant grunted. It was a fucked up night. People died often. Not many, but Grant knew about it even though he was not from Brismwoods. At the moment, he wasn't from anywhere really, but it was all the same to him.
