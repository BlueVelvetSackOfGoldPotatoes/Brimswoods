Grant arrives at the inn. He plays the magic table where he meets Alphonse - a boy whore who serves tables at the inn. Alphonse is being harassed by Grant's game companions which gives Grant a reason to fight, also he is drunk. He fights them. Felipe, the Wizard stops the fight revealing himself to the rest of the folk. Grant is kicked off the inn only to find his horse was stolen. Has he walks off his drunkeness he falls asleep next to the woods, over a cliff only to be awaken by a pixie trap - a beautiful elf woman who really is composed by dozens of smaller meat eating pixies. He is being mesmerised by it and almost gets killed but thankfully Alphonse followed him and because the mesmerising spell does not affect him he is able to push Grant to the ground. Grant wakes up and slices the pixie trap open, lots of pixies fly away but he grabs one from the air. He uses this pixie as a hostage and the other pixies trade something for it. Grant still keeps it for safe keeping, in a small blue velvet pouch.
